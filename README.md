MelodyMind: AI-Powered Music Companion
Custom Music Generation with Transformers and PyTorch
Welcome to MelodyMind, an advanced music generation project that harnesses the capabilities of Transformers and PyTorch. This initiative builds upon existing music generation frameworks, extending their functionality to improve performance, flexibility, and accessibility for a variety of music creation tasks. By leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained Transformer models, MelodyMind offers an innovative approach to AI-driven music composition.

Getting Started
To begin using this AI-powered music generation tool, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository â€“ Download the project to your local machine using git clone.
Install Dependencies â€“ Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install all required Python dependencies.
Run the Application â€“ Execute app.py to generate music sequences with pre-trained models. Adjust parameters and seed inputs as needed to create custom compositions.
Why Use MelodyMind?
While proprietary APIs like OpenAI's offer convenient solutions for AI-driven music generation, MelodyMind provides a cost-effective, flexible, and transparent alternative. By eliminating subscription fees and offering complete control over customization and privacy, this project empowers users to compose music that aligns with their unique creative vision.
